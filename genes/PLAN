Two analyses: based on SCG of GToTree, or this version

Compare free-living to symbionts, assume free living have "all" genes, symbionts will lose things
make ?histogram of gene families/categories/functions in free living
idem for symbionts, and compare histograms
either per species of symbiont or for all cumulative
